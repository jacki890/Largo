Custom landing pages allow you to summarize a series of posts or tie a project together. For one example, see http://inewsnetwork.org/series/hit-and-run: the project page begins with a summary of the series, followed by posts within the series. 

Creating a custom landing page is a simple process. 

1. Make sure "Custom Landing Pages for Series/Project Pages" is enabled in *Appearance &gt; Theme Options &gt; Advanced*.
2. Create a series
3. Add the series to posts
4. Create the landing page

## Creating a series

Create a series in *Posts &gt; Series*. Each series should have a name and a slug. If the new series is part of an already-existing series, you can add the parent series from the drop-down. The description is displayed in the standard landing page layout. The sidebar can be chosen from a list of sidebars. If you want, you can [[create a sidebar just for this series|Theme options]] in *Appearance &gt; Theme Options &tg; Layout Options &gt; Sidebar Options*. 

Once the new series has been saved ("Add New Category"), you can apply it to posts.

## Applying series to posts

Applying a series to a post can be done by selecting the appropriate series from the series list in the post editor.
