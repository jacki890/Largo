0.4: 

- bottom of articles is now a widget area instead of being a fixed order of boxes turned on/off via the theme options
- term archive pages can now have custom sidebars assigned to them (Add Custom Sidebar in Theme Options, then assign sidebar in Categories or Tags, then add widgets to that sidebar area)
- adds “post type” taxonomy which allows for archives by content type and site owners to assign an icon per post type to use as a navigation hint in certain site areas
- homepage template builder is rebuilt (mostly under the hood but does affect theme options somewhat), also several new homepage template options
- by default, stories are single column
- related posts widget rebuilt to use logic to recommend a single story to “read next”, uses editorial input in post metabox of related post ID (for now, we’ll improve the UI eventually) and falls back to automation (using series, categories, tags, etc.)
- adds dialogue on post edit screen to specify a “top term” for each story to be used as a navigation tip and for SEO
- hierarchical category pages use “featured in category” term in the prominence taxonomy to feature stories at the top fo the page
- river presentation of stories uses “featured” term to display stories larger, more prominent
- many widgets are rebuilt, now context-aware so they can be used in different widget areas on different pages and behave appropriately
- sticky header and footer nav on single article pages
- rebuilt mobile nav (removes need for the two navbar menu areas (navbar categories and navbar supplemental) and combines them into one)
