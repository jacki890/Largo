**Categories**: The top level categories used to organize content on your site. We recommend using no more than 8 to 12 categories for your content so think about the top level buckets you might use to group your content and especially how visitors might browse your site. Topic-based categories tend to be more useful than content types (so, "Politics" is more meaningful to a first-time visitor than "Investigations").  
Options:

- Name: The name is how it appears on your site. 
- Slug: The URL-friendly version of the name. It is usually all lowercase and contains only letters, numbers, and hyphens.
- Parent: Drop-down of other categories
- Description: The description is not prominent by default; however, some themes may show it.
- Archive Sidebar: The sidebar to show on this term's archive, chosen from a list of sidebars. Additional sidebars can be created in *Appearance &gt; Theme Options &gt; Layout Options &gt; Sidebar Options &gt; by entering names of new sidebars in the box. 

**Post Prominence**: Used to determine which posts to display on the homepage or in featured posts widgets in the sidebar and footer. You might also add additional categories to this taxonomy to create custom feeds for distribution to content partners.
