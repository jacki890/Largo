## Branching

Each release of Largo (0.3, 0.4, etc) will have a branch of Largo-docs named after that branch. Creating your own branch is as simple as <a href="https://github.com/INN/Largo-docs/fork" target="_blank">forking INN/Largo-docs</a>, making edits to your fork, and [submitting a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) against the current branch of Largo-docs. 

### Submitting pull requests

Make sure that your pull request is submitted to the correct branch of the Largo-docs repository:

Include a description of your changes in your pull request. 

## Updating the INN/Largo wiki

This requires you to be in a team with push access to INN/Largo.

When a new Largo release is out, merge that release's branch with the Largo-docs master branch on GitHub. Then, make sure you're on the Largo-docs `master` branch:

	git fetch Largo-docs
	git checkout Largo-docs/master

Then:

    git remote add wiki git@github.com:INN/Largo.wiki.git
    git push -u wiki master
