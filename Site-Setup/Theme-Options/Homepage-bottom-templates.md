The Largo theme offers three options for the bottom of the homepage, beneath the [[Homepage top template]]. These are set in the Customizer or in *Appearance &gt; Theme Options &gt; Layout Options &gt; Homepage Bottom*.
## List

A single-column list of recent posts with photos and excerpts. 

## Widgets

This creates a two-column widget area and adds it to the list of [[sidebars and widgets|Sidebars and widgets]], allowing you to filter posts by category, tag, or custom taxonomy with widgets. If you want to have posts from multiple categories below the main post, this is the way to go. 

Recommended widgets:

- Largo Featured Posts: shows a set number of featured posts
- Largo Recent Posts: shows a set number of posts and can be limited to one category or none, limited by tags, limited by [[custom taxonomies|Custom taxonomies]], or limited by author.

## None

This option puts no posts beneath the top template on the homepage. Choose your top template carefully. 

-------

The code for these is set in `/home.php`.
