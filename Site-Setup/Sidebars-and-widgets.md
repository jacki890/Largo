## Sidebars and widget areas:

The Largo theme has built in support for three sidebars and two footer widget areas. 

[[sidebars-and-widgets.png]]

Access and edit the these widget areas from the Appearance &gt; Widgets menu in the left sidebar of the WordPress admin interface.

- **Main Sidebar**: used on the homepage as well as on archive, author and search results pages.
- **Single Sidebar**: used for single posts and pages.
- **Topic** (Conditional Home Page Options > Sidebars): 
- **Footer 1, 2, and 3**: The first, second and third widget areas in the footer. If you have chosen a four-column footer layout in *Dashboard &gt; Appearance &gt; Theme Options &gt; Layout Options &gt; Footer Layout*, then a fourth area will be available, called "Footer 4."
- **Article Bottom**: Appears at the bottom of all posts. 
- **Homepage Alert**: 
- **Header Ad Zone**: 
- **Homepage Left Rail**: An optional widget area that, when enabled, appears to the left of the main content area on the homepage

To add widgets to any of these areas, simply drag and drop a widget from the area on left to the widget area you want it to appear in. Note that as soon as you add any widgets to a widget area, the default will no longer display so you will need to completely populate the widget area with the widgets you want to display. Many widgets will have additional settings you can use to configure how they appear on your site.
