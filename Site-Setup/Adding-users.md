## Adding a new user

To add a user, follow [the instructions on the WordPress documentation](http://codex.wordpress.org/Users_Add_New_Screen).

If you have the [[Largo Author Bio|Sidebars and widgets]] widget enabled, you will want to give new writers an author bio. This can be done in their profile, by following the instructions linked above. 

## Setting permissions

WordPress has five levels of users:

- Administrator
- Editor
- Author
- Contributor
- Subscriber

For more information on the user roles and their capabilities, [see the WordPress Codex](http://make.wordpress.org/support/user-manual/customizing-wordpress/managing-users-on-your-wordpress-site/adding-users-to-your-wordpress-site/)
