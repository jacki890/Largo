## Server PHP version

Largo requires a PHP version >=5.3.0. 

## Banner images

To accommodate a number of screen sizes, the Largo theme requires three image sizes for the top banner and automatically chooses the correct image size based on the size of a user's browser window.

- 1170 by 120 px - for most desktop/laptop computers
- 980 by 150 px - for small desktops, most tablets, large phones
- 768 by 200 px - for most mobile phones

If your image is on a white or transparent background we recommend putting the content (logo, etc.) flush against the left side of the image. For the smallest of the three images (768x200) the content should take up the full-width of the image so it fills the header on small screens.

Optionally you can elect to not use images and display a text-only header instead. It will use the site title and tagline from your WordPress settings. (In the WordPress admin left sidebar, click on Settings and then General Settings to change these).

## Thumbnail image

In addition you'll need to create a square thumbnail image (200 by 200 px is ideal) that is used as a fallback when you share posts on Facebook or Twitter for which you have not set a featured image.

## Site title, tagline and description

Before you launch your site you will need to write a title, tagline and a longer description to be used in various places around the site. The title will likely be just your publication or site's name, the tagline should be short (6-8 words) and a short paragraph is sufficient for the site description (you can always add additional information about your organization on your site's "About" page, the short description is just intended to give new visitors an introduction to what your site is about and normally appears as a sidebar widget).

## Social media accounts

The Largo theme supports social media integration at both the site and author level. You can add links to your organization's Facebook page and Twitter account under the Appearance > Theme Options menu and individual authors can add links to their social media accounts by editing their user profile.

## Author Bios and Photos

In addition to adding links to their social media profiles, the authors on your site will want to complete their user profile to at least include a short bio. 

### Gravatar

In addition, they can add a photo [by using Gravatar](http://gravatar.com/). Note that the e-mail used to create their WordPress account *must* match the e-mail they use with Gravatar.

## Google Analytics

If you use Google Analytics, you will want to have your ID handy so you can add it to your Theme Options. Your Google Analytics ID (also called a "property ID" will be in the following format: `UA-XXXXXXXX-X` and is available from the Admin section of [your Google Analytics account](https://www.google.com/analytics/web/?hl=en). Once you add your ID in the Largo Theme Options it will automatically add the appropriate code to all pages of your site so you should not use a plugin or modify the theme to include your Google Analytics code anywhere else.
