The Largo theme comes packaged with plugins original created by NPR for Project Argo. In some cases we have made minor modifications to these plugins to ensure compatibility with the Largo theme so we recommend using the included versions. When you activate the Largo theme you should receive a message at the top of the WordPress admin dashboard that prompts you to install required and recommended plugins.

## Recommended Plugins (Appearance > Install Plugins)

- ~~Argo Media Credit~~ Included in Largo 0.4
- ~~Argo Slideshow~~ Included in Largo 0.4
- [Argo Navis DocumentCloud](https://github.com/INN/navis-documentcloud): Modified from the original version to work  a bit better within a responsive layout. We recommend using the version of the plugin that comes packaged with the Largo theme, but the Argo instructions for [how to add a DocumentCloud document](http://argoproject.org/documentcloud.php) to a post from the Project Argo site are still valid.
- [Argo Links](https://github.com/INN/argo-links): A great way to collect links from around the web and create link roundup posts. We have not made any modifications to this plugin so it will work [exactly as documented on the Project Argo site](http://argoproject.org/argo-links.php).
- [Argo Audio Player](https://github.com/INN/argo-audio-player): Enables you to easily add embedded audio to your posts. Depending on your specific needs you might prefer using a plugin called [PowerPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/powerpress/) to support podcasting or hosting your audio on SoundCloud and embedding the SoundCloud player. Documentation for the Argo Player can be found [on the Project Argo site](http://argoproject.org/audio.php).
<!--
- ~~[Argo Navis Jiffy Posts](https://github.com/INN/navis-jiffy-posts)~~: **Last update  Enables support for embed.ly's oEmbed API. This allows you to easily embed content in WordPress posts using nothing more than a URL. Note that embed.ly is not a free service ([pricing information here](http://embed.ly/pricing)) but might be worth considering if your organization plans to embed a lot of third party content and rich media on your site.
