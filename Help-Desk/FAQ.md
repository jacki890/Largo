## Largo Theme FAQ
#### Q: How do I change the color of the Theme?
**A:** The default color is light blue. Here is how you choose a different color:

* Under **Appearance** > **Theme Options** there is an **Advanced tab** that has an option to **enable custom LESS to CSS for theme customization**
*  Check that box and **save the theme options**
*  On the **Appearance** > **CSS Variables** menu that appears, you can now do some basic customization of the theme (mostly colors)
*  You can use custom CSS to further refine the colors, but this will generally reduce the amount of custom CSS you need to use

#### Q: Can I change the size of the text on the Nav bars and Widgets?
**A:** No, you can't change those values in the Admin UI. That can only be done through custom CSS. We have tested this theme extensively for appearance on desktop to mobile devices to ensure that these elements display properly in all screen sizes. Changing this is not recommended. While you may improve the appearance in one view, it will often look worse on a different device.

#### Q: How do I change the prominence of posts and other items?
**A:** When you edit a post you'll see a number of boxes in the right column with various checkboxes (categories, etc.) one of these is labelled **Prominence**. This controls where certain posts are displayed on the site (i.e. The **top story** on the homepage is selected by checking the **Top Story** box).

* By default, the footer has a widget called **Footer Featured** that will show up to three posts that you select by checking the **Footer Featured widget** box from this prominence box when editing a post
* If you don't see the pProminence box, make sure you're in the **Post Edit** screen, click on **Screen Options** at the top right corner of the screen and make sure the **Prominence** box is checked

#### Q: We switched to a new host, but it's still pointing to the old site. How long does it take for those changes to propagate?
**A:** While the changes may propagate within a couple hours, it can actually take up to **48 hours** for them to take effect. If you **clear your cache** and **try the site from a new internet browser** and still see the old site, or it's pointing to the old host, the changes have not taken effect yet, and you just have to wait it out.

#### Q: As an INN member, can I install WordPress plugins?
**A:** Largo is a theme on a network with many other sites. We keep control of the plugin installation so we can avoid conflicts with the theme and with approved plugins. WordPress has thousands of plugins available, and the potential for them to cause problems is pretty high. If there's a plugin you'd like to install, **ask your Largo administrator to install it for you**. If it's one of our approved and tested plugins, they will install it for you. If not, they'll discuss it on a case-by-case basis.

#### Q: The CSS Customizer doesn't let me change what I want to. How do I make changes to the CSS?
**A:**

* Send us a list of the changes you are requesting and we'll work with you to implement them
* Make those changes in your staging environment and commit them to your Child Theme's repository so we can push them live for you

#### Q: In Largo, can I get the social media buttons to open in a new tab/window?
**A:** Not at this time.

#### Q: In the Largo Follow Widget, can I change the appearance of the social media buttons?
**A:** Those come to us from the providers, so we have very little control over their appearance.
